  The Project Project is a nonprofit, safe, welcoming space for creators to connect.
  Hatred, intolerance, and theft fly directly in the face of our mission and will
  be met with swift reprecussions. There is zero tolerance for the violation of
  our community guidelines, and consequences will range from expulsion to legal
  action. The interpretation of the following guidelines and results of
  their violation are held exclusively by the community's Administrative Board.
