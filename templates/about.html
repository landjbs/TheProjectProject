  </center>
  The Project Project fosters collaboration between college innovators.
  We were founded at Harvard College in July 2020 to help keep students
  connected . Here's how it works:

  <ul>
    <li style='text-decoration: underline; text-align:left;'>Apply:</li>
    Students at supported colleges (currently just Harvard) apply by describing
    their skills and previous projects. We are looking for people at all skill
    levels with an innovative mindset and a lot of passion.

    <li style='text-decoration: underline; text-align:left;'>Join:</li>
